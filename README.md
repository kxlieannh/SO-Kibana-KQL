This repository is maintained by a team under the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for cybersecurity research, development, and educational purposes. However, this repository does not contain proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information belonging to SwRI or any affiliated clients.

All content is curated in a public-facing format to support detection engineering based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, primarily through Kibana Query Language (KQL) for use with Elastic Stack environments (e.g., Security Onion, Elastic SIEM).

# SO-Kibana-KQL
## Welcome to the Security Onion KQL Query Pack, a curated collection of Kibana KQL queries designed for use in Security Onion. These queries are mapped to various MITRE ATT&CK techniques, helping defenders detect, hunt, and alert on suspicious behavior

# Use Cases
### Threat Hunting across MITRE ATT&CK tactics
### Building custom detection rules in Kibana
### Powering dashboards for SOC monitoring
### Creating actionable alerts for real-time response
